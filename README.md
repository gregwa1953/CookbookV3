# CookbookV3
# GUI Cookbook program written in Python and Tk

This project is to act as a repository for my cookbook project.  It is written using Python 3.7.4 and tkinter.  The GUI designer is Page written by Don Rozenberg.  Page is Free Open Source software.  The website for Page is [https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/)

My cookbook program started out in the early 2000's as a recipe database for Android tablets written in B4A.  Version 2 was simply a re-write under Python using Page generated GUIs.  This is version 3 and is still in early development.

More images will become available as development continues.

## Required libraries
At the moment, there are three libraries that will need to be installed before you attempt to run the program(s).  They are:

* Pillow
* requests
* recipe_scrapers

All of these libraries can be installed using the Python pip installer.  As an example, to install the requests library, for Python 2.x you would use:
```bash
$ pip install requests
```
or
```bash
pip3 install requests
```
if you are using Python 3.x (which at this time you _*SHOULD*_ be using anyway).

## Sourcecode considerations

I can, without fear of contradiction, state that my coding style is very old school and more verbose that it "needs" to be.  Basically, I feel that I am a teacher, since I share my source code freely with anyone.  Therefore, I write as if anyone who reads my code is using it for learning purposes.  So I tend to keep the cryptic programming at a level of almost non-existance.  If you feel you don't like my coding style, that's alright.  Others seem to, so you must be in the minority. ;o}

I should put a quick note here about the number of files that make up my program.  When Page generates a GUI, there are three files that are created.  Assuming that your project is named "Project", it would create the following three files:

* Project.tcl (The Page .tcl file)
* Project.py  (What I call the GUI file)
* Project_support.py (where all the modifiable code is placed.)

It is _*NEVER*_ a good idea to modify either of the first two files by hand.  If you do so, there is a very good chance that your program will crash and you will be left with an unusable set of source code.  This is how Page works, and I like it.  When you want to see actual Python source code in any of my projects that use Page, the first place to look at is the *_support.py file.  Earlier, I alluded to the fact that my code is verbose and it's true.  Another habit of mine is that I comment the heck out of my code.  Again, it's because other people learn from my code, I write articles where I teach people about Python programming, and I'm old and have a hard time remembering what I was thinking when I wrote that code.  If you fork or clone or otherwise copy my code, that's fine.  Once it's on your machine, you can remove the comments if you feel moved to do so.

Please note:  This readme file is a living document, as is the source code, and subject to being changed at any time.  Usually in the early mornings when I haven't had enought coffee.

Thank you for stopping by.  I hope you enjoy the code and the program.

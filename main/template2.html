            <li>2 teaspoons cold water</li>
            <li>1/2 (14 ounce) package pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon grapeseed oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine apples, butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a non-stick skillet. Cook over medium heat until
                apples
                have softened, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dissolve cornstarch in cold water. Stir into apple mixture and cook until sauce thickens, about 1
                minute.
                Remove apple pie filling from heat and set aside to cool while you prepare the crust.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unroll pie crust on a lightly floured surface and roll out slightly to smooth the surface of the dough.
                Cut
                the dough into rectangles small enough so that 2 can fit in your air fryer at one time. Repeat with
                remaining crust until you have 8 equal rectangles, re-rolling some of the scraps of dough if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wet the outer edges of 4 rectangles with water and place some apple filling in the center about 1/2-inch
                from the edges. Roll out the remaining 4 rectangles so that they are slightly larger than the filled
                ones.
                Place these rectangles on top of the filling; crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Cut 4 small slits in
                the
                tops of the pies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spray the basket of an air fryer with cooking spray. Brush the tops of 2 pies with grapeseed oil and
                transfer pies to the air fryer basket using a spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
                Insert basket and set the temperature to 385 degrees F (195 degrees C). Bake until golden brown, about 8
                minutes. Remove pies from the basket and repeat with the remaining 2 pies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix together powdered sugar and milk in a small bowl. Brush glaze on warm pies and allow to dry. Serve
                pies
                warm or at room temperature.
            </li>

        </ol>

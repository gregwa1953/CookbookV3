                        Combine apples, butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a non-stick skillet. Cook
                        over
                        medium heat until apples have softened, about 5 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dissolve cornstarch in cold water. Stir into apple mixture and cook until sauce
                        thickens, about 1 minute. Remove apple pie filling from heat and set aside to
                        cool
                        while you prepare the crust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unroll pie crust on a lightly floured surface and roll out slightly to smooth
                        the
                        surface of the dough. Cut the dough into rectangles small enough so that 2 can
                        fit
                        in your air fryer at one time. Repeat with remaining crust until you have 8
                        equal
                        rectangles, re-rolling some of the scraps of dough if needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wet the outer edges of 4 rectangles with water and place some apple filling in
                        the
                        center about 1/2-inch from the edges. Roll out the remaining 4 rectangles so
                        that
                        they are slightly larger than the filled ones. Place these rectangles on top of
                        the
                        filling; crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Cut 4 small slits in the tops of
                        the
                        pies.
                    </p>
                    <p>Spray the basket of an air fryer with cooking spray. Brush the tops of 2 pies
                        with
                        grapeseed oil and transfer pies to the air fryer basket using a spatula.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Insert basket and set the temperature to 385 degrees F (195 degrees C). Bake
                        until
                        golden brown, about 8 minutes. Remove pies from the basket and repeat with the
                        remaining 2 pies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mix together powdered sugar and milk in a small bowl. Brush glaze on warm pies
                        and
                        allow to dry. Serve pies warm or at room temperature.
